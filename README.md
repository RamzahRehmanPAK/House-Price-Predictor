# House-Price-Predictor
Developed a Linear Regression model in python that can take any number of input features to predict price of a house that is on sale. The model performs feature normalization before initiating learning. The learning rate can be adjusted in code. The program also shows a nice graph of learned linear regression function against data-set. It also plots a graph of error cost vs number of iterations to show convergence of gradient descend.
